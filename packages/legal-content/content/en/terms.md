Official contact: **alejoguamialam@gmail.com**.

---

## 2) Eligibility (Minimum age)
The Service is available **only to individuals aged 16 or older**.

---

## 3) Description of the Service

The Service may include, among other features:

- For businesses: publish promotions (subject to requirements and/or verification), create branches (subject to requirements), validate QR codes, access metrics (subject to plan/conditions).
- For support/admin: ticket handling, report review, moderation, verification, and security actions.

> Note: The Service may be in “ALPHA/BETA”. Benefits and limits may change prior to a final release.

---

## 4) Registration and access
You may create an account or sign in using:
- Email and password
- OAuth (planned/current): Google, Facebook, Apple, X (Twitter), Discord

You agree to provide accurate information and keep it updated. You are responsible for all activity under your account.

---

## 5) Roles and permissions
The App may use roles such as:
- **Customer**
- **Business**
- **Support** (employee/collaborator with limited permissions)
- **Admin** (full management access)

Your role determines what you can see and do. We may restrict features for security, compliance, or Service integrity.

---

## 6) Account verification and limits
The App may offer **additional benefits** to verified accounts (for example: greater visibility, higher limits for promotions/branches, access to certain features). Verification:
- Is **optional**, but may unlock additional benefits.
- For businesses, may require documentation (for example: **RUC**, national ID photo, and face verification/photo), reviewed **manually**.
- Unverified accounts may face limits (e.g., publishing 1 promotion for a limited period) and reduced visibility.

We may update verification criteria or related benefits and will provide reasonable notice through the Service when practicable.

---

## 7) Promotions, redemptions, and responsibility
### 7.1 Publication and approval
Promotions published by businesses may be reviewed and remain “pending” until approved by the system/support.  
We may reject, remove, or restrict promotions that violate these Terms or our policies.

### 7.2 Redemption conditions
Each promotion may have conditions (for example: individual redemption, group redemption, minimum group size, new referral requirement, time limits).  
The App aims to present these conditions, but the business is responsible for honoring what it offers and for actual availability.

### 7.3 No commercial guarantee
The Operator **does not guarantee**:
- That a business will always honor a promotion,
- That a promotion will be available at all times, or
- That any user will achieve specific results.

The Service acts as a platform to connect users and manage redemption flows. In case of disputes, you may report via support and we will make reasonable efforts to assist, without assuming direct liability for a business’s operations.

---

## 8) QR codes, groups, and fraud prevention
QR codes and redemption mechanisms are used to validate conditions and prevent abuse. You must not:
- Reuse or manipulate QR codes,
- Share redemption QR codes when prohibited by a promotion,
- Simulate groups or create fake referrals,
- Attempt to exploit vulnerabilities.

We may apply anti-fraud measures, including suspension, blocking, reversal of benefits/points, tier/league resets, and account termination for serious or repeated violations.

---

## 9) Points, tiers/leagues, and seasons
The App may award points for valid actions (for example, confirmed redemptions). Key rules:
- Points may **not expire as a balance**, but the App may operate **seasons** (e.g., every 3 months) for rankings/leagues.
- Points are not guaranteed if redemption conditions are not met.
- In cases of fraud, we may invalidate points and apply sanctions.

---

## 10) User-Generated Content (UGC): comments, photos, reports
Users may generate content such as comments, ratings, photos, and reports.

### 10.1 Prohibited content
You must not post content that includes:
- Personal data (phone numbers, emails, personal addresses, or other sensitive identifiers)
- Hate/violence, harassment, threats, defamation
- Explicit sexual content or pornography
- Impersonation, spam, malicious links
- Content involving minors or exploitation of minors
- Instructions for or promotion of illegal activity
- Content that infringes copyright, trademark, or other rights

### 10.2 Moderation and removal
We may remove, limit, or restrict content due to:
- Violations of these rules,
- Credible reports,
- Spam or risk signals.

### 10.3 Appeals
If you believe your content was removed in error, you may request review by emailing **alejoguamialam@gmail.com** with sufficient supporting information. We reserve the final decision.

---

## 11) Intellectual property
The Service, its design, software, branding, logos, and proprietary content belong to the Operator (and in the future, to the company that operates it).  
User-generated content remains owned by its authors, but by posting it you grant us a limited, non-exclusive license to host, store, display, moderate, and use it as necessary to operate and improve the Service.

---

## 12) Payments, plans, and benefits for businesses
The Service may offer plans/packages for visibility or benefits for businesses.

### 12.1 Current payment methods
For now, payments are made **by bank transfer** to banks in Ecuador (e.g., Pichincha, Pacífico, Guayaquil, Produbanco).  
Later we may enable card/debit/credit payments and recurring billing where applicable.

### 12.2 Changes to plans/benefits
Plans, prices, and benefits may change. We will provide reasonable notice when practicable.  
Benefits available during beta may differ from those in a final release.

### 12.3 Mandatory reference for reconciliation
For bank-transfer purchases, each order may generate a payment reference (e.g., `RA-NEG-XXXX-YYYY`).  
If a transfer is sent without the reference, the payment may remain “pending reconciliation” until manually verified.

---

## 13) Refund policy (bank transfers and purchases)
### 13.1 Base rule (full refund)
A **full refund** may be granted only if **all** of the following are met:
1) Requested within **72 hours** of payment activation/confirmation (our “service receipt” point).  
2) The plan/package **has not been used** (or only minimally used). “Use” includes, for example:
   - Publishing a promotion (or having it approved and made visible),
   - Consuming benefits (extra slots, “hot” placement, etc.),
   - Creating extra branches enabled by the plan.
3) The payment is identifiable and matches the account.

If there was usage, we may offer **internal credit** or **pro-rated relief**, depending on the circumstances.

### 13.2 Anti-fraud rules (non-negotiable)
We do not refund money if:
- A refund is requested to a bank account different from the payer or business owner,
- Proof of payment is missing or does not match,
- The business is under fraud/abuse investigation (we may freeze the case until resolved),
- There are signs of repeated refund attempts or risk patterns.

### 13.3 Alternatives when a cash refund does not apply
We may offer:
- Internal credit (balance for a future plan/package),
- Plan extension (+X days),
- Immediate downgrade + proportional credit.

### 13.4 Processing times
Refunds may take **5 to 10 business days** (or more) depending on verification and banking timelines.

---

## 14) Suspension, restriction, and termination
We may suspend, restrict, or terminate accounts if:
- You violate these Terms,
- There is fraud, abuse, or security risk,
- Required by law or regulatory demands.

When possible, we will provide notice and an opportunity to appeal, except in urgent security situations.

---

## 15) Availability and Service changes
The Service may change, be updated, or be temporarily unavailable.  
We do not guarantee uninterrupted availability. Maintenance and updates may occur.

---

## 16) Limitation of liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law:
- The Operator is not liable for indirect damages, lost profits, or consequential losses arising from use of the Service.
- The Operator’s total liability is limited to the amount paid by the user to the Operator in the **last 3 months** (if applicable), except where mandatory law requires otherwise.

---

## 17) Dispute resolution
We will first attempt to resolve disputes through support: **alejoguamialam@gmail.com**.  
If unresolved, the parties submit to the competent jurisdiction of **Quito, Ecuador**, and **Ecuadorian law** will apply.

---

## 18) Changes to these Terms
We may update these Terms. We will publish the updated version and update the date.  
If changes are material, we will attempt to notify you in a reasonable manner within the Service.
