This page explains how you can **request deletion of data associated with your account** in **Referidos App (provisional name)**, including data linked to the use of **Facebook Login (Meta)**.

---

## 1) Primary method: delete your account from within the App (recommended)
The fastest and most direct way is to use the in-app account deletion option:

**Profile → Manage account → Delete account**

When you confirm deletion:
- We begin the process of deleting (or anonymizing, where appropriate) data associated with your account.
- Your account will no longer be available for normal use.

> Important: for security reasons, certain actions may require **reauthentication** (for example, confirming your identity again before completing account deletion).

---

## 2) If you cannot access your account (email request)
If you **cannot sign in** or do not have access to the App, you may request deletion by email.

Send an email to: **alejoguamialam@gmail.com**  
Suggested subject: **“Data Deletion Request”**

Please include:
- The **email address** used to create or access your account (or your Facebook account email, if applicable).
- Your **role** in the App (customer or business), if you remember it.
- Your **public user ID** (if available in your profile), or any information that helps us identify your account.
- (Optional) A screenshot of your profile or the sign-in error, to help prevent impersonation.

We will process your request once we can reasonably verify you are the account holder.

## 3) What data is deleted
When you delete your account (in-app) or submit a validated request, we aim to delete or anonymize (as applicable) data associated with your account, for example:

### 3.1 Account and profile data
- Account and profile identifiers (as applicable)
- Alias/name (if you provided it)
- Saved addresses (province/city/area/street and associated coordinates, if applicable)
- Basic profile preferences

### 3.2 In-app usage data
- Data related to promotions, redemptions, points, and tiers/leagues (as applicable)
- Group participation data (as applicable)

### 3.3 User-generated content (UGC)
- Comments, ratings, and reports
- Photos attached to comments (if used)
- Business-uploaded content (business/branch/promo photos), if applicable

> Note: In some cases, certain content may be **anonymized** (for example, keeping content without directly identifying you) to protect platform integrity, prevent abuse, or preserve public-facing consistency where reasonably necessary.

---

## 4) Data that may be retained temporarily (limited retention)
For **security, auditing, fraud prevention, and support** purposes, certain data may be retained for a **limited period** after account deletion, and then deleted or anonymized.

Typical examples include:

### 4.1 Support tickets and audit records
- Standard tickets: up to **3 months**
- Critical/problematic tickets: up to **6 months**
- Internal notes and audit events tied to tickets: for as long as the relevant ticket exists

### 4.2 Technical logs (diagnostics and security)
- General technical logs: typically **20 to 90 days**, depending on relevance
- Logs collected specifically to resolve a ticket: may be retained **until the associated ticket is deleted**

### 4.3 Compliance and abuse prevention
If there is a security incident, fraud, abuse, or an internal investigation, we may retain the minimum necessary information for a reasonable period to address and resolve the matter.

---

## 5) Business verification data (if applicable)
If you are a business and completed verification (for example RUC/tax ID, ID document photo, selfie/face verification):
- Such files are stored with restricted access (admin/authorized support only).
- Under normal circumstances, these files are typically deleted within **20 to 30 days** after verification is completed (unless there is a legitimate security need or a legal obligation to retain them).

---

## 6) Facebook Login (Meta): what “data deletion” means
If you used **Facebook Login**, deleting your data means:
- Deleting (or anonymizing, where appropriate) the data associated with your account in our App.
- It does **not** delete your Facebook account or data controlled by Facebook.

If you also want to revoke the App’s access via Facebook:
- You can do so in your Facebook settings (Apps and Websites) by removing **Referidos App (provisional name)**.

---

## 7) Processing time
- If you delete your account from within the App: the deletion process starts immediately.
- If you request deletion by email: we typically process requests within **7 to 30 days**, depending on identity verification and request volume.
