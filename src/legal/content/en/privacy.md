We collect information depending on your role (Customer/Business) and how you use the Service.

### 2.1 Account and authentication data

- Internal user identifiers and account metadata
- Authentication method(s) used (e.g., email/password, OAuth providers)
- Session and security-related data managed by the authentication provider (e.g., tokens and related metadata)

**Customers may provide:**

### 2.4 Location and address data
We may collect location-related information in two main ways:

**A) Location you actively provide**
- Address and coordinates you select on a map or enter when saving an address.
- Metadata returned by a geocoding provider (e.g., place identifiers, structured address fields).

**B) Location updates (where supported)**
- When your device and browser allow it and you grant permission, we may update your location to improve the relevance of nearby promotions.

#### Background location (web/PWA)
Background location capabilities vary by browser/device and permission model:
- If supported and authorized, we may update location **when the App is not open**.
- If not supported, location is obtained **only while the App is open** or when you interact with maps/address features.

**Control:** You can disable background location (if available) from the App settings and/or your browser/device permissions.

### 2.5 Technical, analytics, and security data
- Device and browser information (general model, OS, version, user agent or similar signals)
- Service/build version (e.g., app_version)
- App routes/screens relevant for diagnostics
- Technical event logs, error reports, and troubleshooting “breadcrumbs”

---

## 3) How we use information
We use information to:
- Create and manage accounts and profiles
- Enable sign-in and account security
- Show relevant promotions (including location-based relevance where enabled)
- Manage QR redemption flows, groups, points, tiers/leagues, and validations
- Moderate content, prevent fraud, and protect the integrity of the Service
- Provide support, investigate incidents, and improve reliability
- Manage business plans/packages and payment reconciliation (when applicable)

---

## 4) Legal basis for processing
Depending on the context, we process information under one or more of these bases:
- **Performance of the Service** requested by you (account creation, redemption flows, support)
- **Legitimate interests** related to security, fraud prevention, and Service integrity (e.g., audit logs, abuse prevention), balanced against your rights
- **Consent** where required (e.g., location permissions)
- **Legal obligations** where applicable

---

## 5) Device permissions (location)
The App may request browser/device permissions for:
- **Location**, to center the map, save coordinates, or improve promotion relevance

You can withdraw permission at any time via browser/device settings. Some features may degrade or become unavailable if location is disabled.

---

## 6) Business account verification (sensitive/high-risk data)
To enable additional benefits and reduce abuse, we may request verification information from business accounts, which may include:
- RUC
- National ID photo (cédula)
- Face photo/selfie or face scan (or equivalent)

### Storage and access
- Verification files may be stored in **Supabase Storage**.
- Access is restricted to **authorized admin/support roles** and only for verification, fraud prevention, and related support.

### Retention
- Verification files are typically deleted within **20–30 days** after verification completes, unless a legitimate security need or legal requirement justifies longer retention (e.g., fraud investigations).

### Attempts
- Up to **3 verification retries** may be allowed, after which a temporary block may be applied with support assistance available.

---

## 7) Support via WhatsApp and email
- You may contact us via email and/or WhatsApp.
- **Currently, we do not store WhatsApp chat message content** in our database.
- We may store in our support system: ticket ID, case summary, event history, internal notes, and minimum technical context needed to resolve the issue.
- If we later integrate WhatsApp’s official API to store conversations, we will notify users before activation and define a limited retention period tied to the ticket lifecycle.

---

## 8) Logs, security records, and retention
### 8.1 Technical logs and error tracking
We keep technical logs for:
- Diagnosing failures and maintaining security
- Supporting audits for relevant support cases

### 8.2 Retention (general rules)
We apply retention limits to avoid excessive storage:
- **Standard support tickets:** up to **3 months**
- **Critical/problematic tickets:** up to **6 months**
- **Logs captured to resolve a specific ticket:** retained **until the associated ticket is deleted**
- Other technical/security logs are retained for limited periods based on relevance and then rotated or deleted

Retention may be extended where reasonably necessary for security investigations, compliance, or dispute handling.

---

## 9) How we share information
We do **not** sell your personal data.

We may share information:
- With **infrastructure providers** required to operate the Service (hosting, database, authentication, storage)
- With **authorized admin/support staff**, access-limited by role and need-to-know
- To comply with **valid legal requests** from competent authorities
- To prevent fraud/abuse and protect rights, safety, and the integrity of the Service

---

## 10) International transfers (Ecuador → Brazil)
We use infrastructure located in **São Paulo, Brazil** (e.g., Supabase) to store and process data. This means your data may be processed outside Ecuador for operational reasons.

Where applicable, we take reasonable steps to ensure providers apply appropriate security and confidentiality measures consistent with the Service’s needs.

---

## 11) User-generated content (comments/photos/reports)
UGC is used to operate social/reputation features and for moderation and safety.
- Content may be moderated and removed if it violates our rules or poses risks.
- You may request review/appeal if you believe removal was incorrect by contacting: **alejoguamialam@gmail.com**.

---

## 12) Your rights and choices
Depending on applicable law and context, you may:
- Access and update certain information from your profile/settings
- Request correction or deletion of data where applicable
- Request assistance by email for changes not available in the App

Some information may not be deletable on request if it must be retained for security, audit, fraud prevention, dispute resolution, or legal compliance (e.g., limited support ticket records for defined periods).

---

## 13) Security
We implement reasonable security measures (access controls, role-based permissions, restricted storage access, etc.). However, no system is 100% secure. You should protect your account and avoid sharing credentials.

---

## 14) Cookies and local storage (web/PWA)
The App may use browser storage mechanisms (cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB) to:
- Maintain sessions and essential preferences
- Improve user experience (e.g., remembering minimal settings)

We do not use “dark patterns.” If we introduce non-essential third-party analytics/cookies in the future, we will request consent where required and avoid disrupting critical flows.

---

## 15) Changes to this Policy
We may update this Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version and revise the “Last updated” date. If changes are material, we will try to provide a reasonable in-Service notice.
